#Prework for Boot camp 
## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

I created this project in order to help boot camp students and myself to have a place where I can easily organize and access information and notes from boot camp. What better way to keep notes about building a website than by building a website about building a website? Besides such a meta reason, I built the project in order to understand the concepts in a more cohesive way by also keeping it in one place. I learned a lot about navigating on the CLI and using the coding languages of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as effective workflows that will be helpful for future projects.

## Usage
It is organized into the sections of HTML, Git, CSS, and JavaScript and each section contains notes about each topic. The titles currently have a bug that will be addressed soon since the title of 'CSS' is missing. If you get DevTools Console running on the website you can see the JavaScript running. The Javascript contains the list of topics to study and will give recommendations of what topics to study first.
